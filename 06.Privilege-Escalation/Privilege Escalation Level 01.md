#### Privilege Escalation Level 01 - Back to the old school

Google all information it gives you on the simulate terminal screen, you'll find an exploit.  
Notice that you have to use the "one" user to login, and don't forget the last "enter".  
  
If you can't login and have to input username again and again, try
```javascript
var userip='8.8.8.8';
```
in your JavaScript console.
