#### Advanced Level 4 - Local File Inclusion/WAF Bypass

Remember? Your image has been uploaded to /challenges/advanced/uploads/Ac3sk9j.jpg  
Figure out a way to execute the php code from the image you uploaded.  
  
Google "local file inclusion (LFI)". Also you'll have to bypass a Web Application Firewall(WAF).  
  
If your null character doesn't work, try another escape character.  
  
If the picture is not in this directory, Use "../" to get into the parent directory.
And if "../" is removed by the WAF, what would be the easiest way to bypass it?
