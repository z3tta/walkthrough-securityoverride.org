#### Basic Level 8 - Low level SQL injection

This is the first challenge of securityoverride.org which confuses me.
If you try many payloads and none of them is working, don't worry, so do I.
I guess that all the challenges use script to check our answer, in other words, it's not real vulnerable.
If your payloads can't pass the script check, even they do work in the real situation, you'll fail.
Only a very simple payload works.
If you really have no idea, google "The complete guide to SQL Injections".
