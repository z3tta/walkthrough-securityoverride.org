#### Basic Level 15 - Unique / Obscure XSS

You don't need to inject your code in the comment box. You need to inject it after the URL.
Check the source code, you'll see a hint about "PHP_SELF", google it.  
    
Or read this paper: <http://seancoates.com/blogs/xss-woes>
    
There is a filter. But if you inject the right xss code you will pass the challange anyways.
The mission is simulated and hence only the "expected" answer produces a "good" output.
Just assume there are no filters and don't rely on the feedback.  
  
Use ' and keep it simple.
